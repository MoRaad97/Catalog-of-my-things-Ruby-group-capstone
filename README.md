# Catalog of my things

This project involves creating a console app that helps one keep a record of different types of things they own: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything is based on the UML class diagram presented below. 
The data is stored in JSON files but a database ia also prepared with tables structure analogical to the program's class structure.
